<p font style="color: white"> As the M.K.P Podcasts main quiz master, Matt enjoys causing Kush and Paul to rage with the Letterboxd review quizzes. Matt will usually try to lead into the trending news segments of each episode (at least he will when he can actually find news to talk about). He also created the robot voice (who we like to call Robert) heard in the M.K.P Podcast theme song. At the time of writing this, Matt currently holds the record for having done the most intros with 6. Outside of the podcast Matt has also made a few short films, one of which won a college award for best video production. </p><br>

<h3 font style="color: white">K - Kush</h3>

<div>
  <img src="img/Kush.PNG" alt="Kush" width="85%">
</div>

<p font style="color: white">With 2 Letterboxd quiz wins and 2 ranking quiz wins, Kush stands tall as the quiz champion of the M.K.P Podcast. Currently Kush is the only M.K.P Podcast host who has not been absent for a single episode (Although his internet connection often tries to change that). During his time on the podcast Kush has also showcased his incredible singing voice, leading to him performing the M.K.P Podcast theme song for Episode 10. Fun fact: Kush is the most followed indvidual host on social media. He also passionately dislikes the movie Gemini Man.</p><br>

<h3 font style="color: white">P - Paul</h3>

<div>
  <img src="img/Paul.png" alt="Paul" width="83%">
</div>

<p font style="color: white">Unfortunately for Paul, he has proven to have the worst luck when it comes to M.K.P Podcast quizzes, having lost all but 1. Evidently he knows all about Christmas movies though, with the Christmas Letterboxd quiz being his first (and only) win. Paul has found himself being censored multiple times on the podcast, this is because he has a habit of [Redacted]. When he's not making his co-hosts laugh, Paul is either busy being the drummer in the band 'Undamaged Destiny' or he's on Facebook.</p><br>
